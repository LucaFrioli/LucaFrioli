## 👋 Hi, I'm @LucaFrioli, a Brazilian who loves technology;
👀 I’m interested in learnig new technologys and improve what I alredy now, Web tech lover, searching work in this area;

🌱 I study Javascript and Typescript every day, my focus is currently on the backend, the area in which I feel the greatest affinity, and it excites me. In the search to improve my skills in the area I started studying Rust looking to carry out webassebly projects (I'm still starting, but having a little more content I will release my study repo on this). I can't wait to put my skills to the test;

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with the community as one... learning from the most experienced, and passing on my experiences to those who are still learning;

📫 How to reach me lucafrioli7@gmail.com or +55(19)99663-1705;
